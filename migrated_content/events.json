Development Initiatives (DI) is running \u2018Building coherence between crisis, development and peace actors\u2019, a series of webinars that aim to bring together actors from all sides to lay the foundations for future talks on building greater collaboration, coherence and complementarity.</p><p>The second webinar, \u2018Financing trends in crisis-affected contexts: Launch of the 2019 Global Humanitarian Assistance report\u2019, focuses on contexts where humanitarian, development and peace actors often work alongside each other: protracted crises. This online event will provide actors working in these settings with the latest data and analysis on financing responses. Participants will have the chance to hear from crisis finance experts as they discuss current and emerging trends, how these might influence practice, opportunities for joined-up working and the data gaps that still need to be addressed. The full Global Humanitarian Assistance (GHA) report will be published online, in advance of the webinar, on 30 September.</p><p>In recent years, interest in building greater collaboration, coherence and complementarity in the responses of humanitarian, development and peace actors in crisis contexts has gained momentum. Crises have become increasingly complex and protracted in nature, and a growing proportion of the world\u2019s poor people are projected to be living in fragile and crisis countries by 2030; these trends underline the need for longer-term approaches in protracted crisis contexts and appropriate financing mechanisms as the \u2018glue\u2019 that \u2013 through joint assessments, planning, programming, financing and results \u2013 has the potential to bring actors together.</p><p>In recognition of this need, commitments to improve humanitarian\u2013development\u2013peace collaboration and coherence have emerged from several global policy processes over recent years. These policy commitments include: the New Way of Working to achieve \u2018collective outcomes\u2019, emerging from World Humanitarian Summit (2016) as a core aspect of the \u2018Agenda for Humanity\u2019; the Grand Bargain commitments; the new OECD DAC recommendation on the humanitarian\u2013development\u2013peace nexus; the SDGs and ambition to Leave No One Behind; and the Addis Ababa Agenda for Action (2015).</p><p>The forthcoming fora of the IMF and World Bank Annual Autumn and Spring meetings, the 2020 Financing for Development Forum and 2020 ECOSOC Humanitarian Affairs Segment offer opportunities to discuss and make progress on this issue.</p><p>We welcome feedback on the agenda of the series and questions for discussion; please read the full details of the series and its aims in Sarah Dalrymple\u2019s blog\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/building-greater-coherence-across-development-crisis-and-peace-sectors/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, and contact her on\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:Sarah.Dalrymple@devinit.org\" target=\"_blank\">Sarah.Dalrymple@devinit.org</a>.</p><p>Please register to attend the webinar <a href=\"https://app.livestorm.co/devinit/financing-trends-in-crisis-affected-contexts-launch-of-the-2019-global-humanitarian-assistance-report\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p>You can watch the first webinar in the series <a href=\"http://devinit.org/post/emerging-trends-development-finance-mean-crisis-actors/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, and follow updates on Twitter using <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ditriplenexus\" target=\"_blank\">#DITripleNexus</a>.</p>"}, {"title": "County spending on climate change and disaster risk reduction: Evidence from the budgets of four counties", "date": "", "time": "", "location": "", "format": "Event", "description": "Attend our event on 23 May in Kisumu County at the Jumuia Hotel to the discuss policies put in place by the four counties towards climate change and DRR.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/county-spending-climate-change-disaster-risk-reduction-evidence-budgets-four-counties/", "body": "<p><strong>Location </strong>Kisumu County at the Jumuia Hotel</p><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Kenya is increasingly experiencing severe droughts followed by heavy floods, the recurrence and intensity of which is closely linked with climate change.

Development Initiatives (DI) is running \u2018Building coherence between crisis, development and peace actors\u2019, a series of webinars that aim to bring together actors from all sides to lay the foundations for future talks on building greater coherence.</p><p>The first webinar \u2018What do emerging trends in development finance mean for crisis actors?\u2019 will provide actors working in fragile and crisis contexts with information on development financing processes, structures and trends. Participants will have the chance to hear from development and crisis finance experts, pose questions and explore the possibilities for joint working towards financing for collective outcomes.</p><p>The nature of crises is changing. Crises have become increasingly complex and protracted in nature, and a growing proportion of the world\u2019s poor people will live in fragile and crisis-affected contexts by 2030.</p><p>These shifts in the context \u2013 and deepening links between poverty, vulnerability and crisis \u2013 have reinvigorated the argument calling for greater coherence in the responses of crisis and development actors in protracted crisis contexts. Increasingly, there is more recognition of the need for longer-term development approaches in crises and a heightened awareness that working coherently to address the needs of vulnerable people can strengthen effectiveness.</p><p>Against this backdrop, several global policy processes have emerged \u2013 including the \u2018New Way of Working\u2019 emerging out of the World Humanitarian Summit (2016), the Grand Bargain commitments (2016), the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the new DAC Recommendation on Humanitarian-Development-Peace nexus agreed earlier this year.</p><p>However, while there is growing consensus for a longer-term development approach, and coherence at the international level, it is commonly acknowledged that development and crisis-financing actors operate in silos and the practical delivery of these commitments is the biggest challenge. Additionally, historical divides in the development and crisis-financing architectures continue to provide insufficient space for systemic joined-up working.</p><p>\u2018Building coherence between crisis, development and peace actors\u2019 will provide a series of opportunities for inclusive discussion of these key issues, and a chance to build consensus around the next steps towards more effective ways of working.

The P20 are the people in the poorest 20% of the population globally, and for Agenda 2030 to be implemented, they must be tracked to ensure they are included in progress. Otherwise, they risk being left further behind.</p><p>The Governments of Switzerland and Benin have been using the idea of the P20 to examine the extent to which the poorest 20% of people are included in progress in their own countries. The purpose of this event is to examine advances in implementing the commitment to leave no one behind at country level.

The rule changes are expected to be adopted at the next High Level Meeting in October 2017.</p><p>This free webinar will provide an overview of the key changes likely to be agreed in October. These include: changes to rules on ODA loans and debt relief; new purpose codes and sector codes; changes to in-donor refugee costs; the introduction of new forms of aid aimed at \u2018mobilising\u2019 private investments for development; and new peace and security related activities.</p><p>Participants will learn the basic facts about how modernised ODA will work, how this might affect incentives for DAC donors in their aid allocations, and how reported ODA numbers might be affected. We\u2019ll also share a timeline for the process and its implementation.</p><p>The webinar is intended for those working directly on ODA policy and advocacy, as well as stakeholders in the wider aid community who need to understand the context for their work.

How does the concept of the Data Revolution help policy makers meet their agreements on pursuing the SDGs?</li>\n</ol><p>In the <em>East Africa Chronic Poverty Report</em> to be published by DI, it is estimated that 25 million people are in long-term poverty in the region. The report concludes that East Africa has a very high number of people trapped in extreme and chronic poverty. This presents a major challenge to the region\u2019s growth and development progress.</p><p>While reflecting on the outcomes of the Addis Ababa conference, the vice president of the Association of German Development NGOs (Venro) Professor Christa Plath noted that a lot more should be done than just polices being formulated. <em>\u201cA major challenge that we are facing is that we have global policies but no global framework for implementing development. Ultimately, we are living in a world of global irresponsibility\u201d</em> she said.</p><p><em>\u201cAs a region, we must strive to ensure that growth is sustainable, inclusive and equitable all at the same time, and this may pose some challenges\u201d</em> \u2013 Mr. Charles Lwanga-Ntale, Regional Director for DI Africa Hub.</p><h4>The East African context</h4><p>Different countries in the East Africa region struggle with the same issues only different in scale and context. Some of the crosscutting challenges as well as opportunities are elaborated on below:</p><p>1. Ownership of projects and development</p><p>There is a sense of disconnect between the national and subnational levels of administration. The subnational levels of government and communities are viewing the MDGs and SDGs as national government programmes. In some cases communities are yet to understand how the actualisation of the development goals would impact on their lives.</p><p>For the SDGs to be realised, there is a need for ownership of the projects at the national and subnational levels. Governments in the East Africa region need to find strategies of sensitising the citizens and having them own the processes of realising the SDGs in Africa.</p><p>2. Governance</p><p>The role of politics in the actualisation of development goals cannot be a neglected. The low trust issues that have troubled political institutions in East Africa and Africa at large need to be addressed to realise progress.</p><p><em>\u201cIt is critical for us to find ways to make political and government institutions high-trust institutions because, if we don\u2019t, it will be impossible to use their resources adequately, effectively responsibly and with integrity\u201d</em> \u2013 Hon. \u00a0Zein Abubakar, Member of Parliament, East Africa Legislative Assembly.</p><p>3. Planning/visioning processes (aligning global agreements to national and subnational processes and instruments)</p><p>There have been planning and visioning processes[1] by countries in the region. We must bring all the visions of the various countries to speak to each other. We must harmonise and integrate these visions so as to achieve their goals collectively as a region.</p><p><em>\u00a0\u201cWe must bring all these visions of different countries to speak to one another to achieve development together as a region\u201d</em> \u2013 Hon.\u00a0 Zein Abubakar, Member of Parliament, East Africa Legislative Assembly.</p><p>4. Data Revolution</p><p>Data should be prioritised by countries in the East Africa region when planning. The Data Revolution needs to move from talking about it to actioning it in terms of quality, accessibility and use of data and how we can create frameworks at subnational, national, regional and continental levels. Data should not only be used for monitoring what we have done but also to plan for what we have not done.</p><p><em>\u201cThe Data Revolution does not only speak of putting data in the hands of people, and using data not just for monitoring what we have done as we have done in the past, but also on how can we use data to plan for what we do not have.\u201d</em> \u2013 Crystal Simioni , Programme Development Manager at HIVOS.</p><p>Another feature of the plan for the SDGs (as distinct from the MDGs) is the grouping of peace and security issues under the development banner. The reason is that conflict impacts whether countries advance in their development or not.\u00a0For Africa, putting peace and security into the SDGs directs attention to conflict-preventing factors such as equity, inclusiveness and rule of law.</p><p>Further climate change is an emerging issue that the SDGs must address. International development agencies and green groups believe that delivering sustainable development and tackling climate change go hand in hand.</p><p>In their current form, the SDGs are more focused on building productive capacity and give more weight to economic and environmental factors, which are also key features of the \u2018Common African Position (CAP) on the post-2015 development agenda\u2019. The CAP was the consensus of African leaders, civil society and the private sector.</p><h4>Where do we go from here?</h4><p>DI believes there a number of steps that should be put in place in order to deliver on the SDGs to be adopted this September. We continue to work with <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/new-partnership-help-east-africans-access-use-understand-statistical-data-information\">partners</a> to enhance their capacity to collect, understand and use data. We strive to lead in analysis and understanding what it would take to mobilise and raise resources and how all resources will contribute in achieving the SDGs.</p><p>Some of the initiatives that we have been undertaking are to lead in the <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/launch-of-the-development-data-hub-in-uganda\">realisation of a data revolution</a> in East Africa to aid in planning and resource allocations.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.vision2030.go.ke/\">Kenya vision 2030</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http://npa.ug/uganda-vision-2040/\">Uganda Vision 2040</a></p>"}, {"title": "KODI reaches out to data users", "date": "", "time": "", "location": "", "format": "Event", "description": "In 2010, Kenya adopted a new constitution.

Many African countries, including those in East Africa, still grapple with development challenges as poverty and inequality persist. Facilitating access to data and information for citizens, governments, development partners, private sector, and civil society is now viewed as one of the ways to bolster socio-economic growth that leaves no one behind. However, challenges remain despite improvements being made by governments in making data available. Many citizens, civil society organisations (CSOs) and decision makers find it difficult to access timely, relevant and sufficiently disaggregated data. Those who are able to access it quite often lack the capacity to make sense of it, or even effectively use it.</p><p>Development Initiatives (DI) has been engaging with multiple stakeholders on the importance of access and use of data and information at the global, regional, national, sub-national and community levels, with the ultimate aim of contributing to the end of extreme poverty by 2030. DI sees access to information as a necessary tool for effective decision making, planning and resource allocation. Even before the call for a data revolution by the High-Level Panel, we were already engaging multiple stakeholders in Uganda under the auspices of the <a href=\"http://opendevdata.ug/\">Uganda Open Development Partnership Platform</a>, an initiative aimed at facilitating access to official and non-official data, and lately <a href=\"http://devinit.org/#!/post/interoperable-data-uganda\">Joined Up Data Uganda</a> (JUDU), that seeks to facilitate access to joined up data for better decision making at the district level in the country.</p><p>DI first launched the Development Data Hub in Washington DC on 17 April 2015. It is a comprehensive online resource for financial and resource flow data alongside poverty, social and vulnerability indicators. It is now being launched in Uganda as part of an effort to contextualise the access to national and sub-national level data. It combines an extensive data store with interactive visualisations enabling the user to chart, map and compare poverty, vulnerability and financial resource flow data at the global, national and sub-national/local government level. It brings together several data sets, allowing cross-country comparisons of data down to sub-national level.</p><p>It is envisaged that the Development Data Hub will make it easy for researchers, CSOs, community-based organisations, policy makers, media and other data users to analyse, interpret and make well-informed decisions based on credible evidence.

Innovations in financing and global processes taking place during 2015 and 2016 \u2013 from the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk.\u00a0Reduction to the Financing for Development process and the World Humanitarian Summit \u2013 offer particularly important opportunities to shape global strategies across the development and humanitarian spheres for years to come.</p><p>Providing an evidence base for the search for solutions to these challenges of resourcing humanitarian action, the Global Humanitarian Assistant (GHA) Report 2015 will be launched online on Thursday 18 June.

Globally, over a third of funding requirements went unmet in UN-coordinated humanitarian appeals alone during 2013 (with only US$8.5 billion of US$13.2 billion UN-coordinated appeal requirements met). Despite the emergence of new donors, the number, scale and severity of crises is outstripping resourcing. At the same time, humanitarian assistance is being called on to cover an ever-widening agenda from preparedness to recovery.</p><p>The scale of needs calls for a different response. New and innovative sources of funding must be found and scaled up, and at the same time, existing resources must be used more effectively. Strengthening the effectiveness of the humanitarian response and filling the current funding gap through new approaches to financing is a topic of growing international interest and a central component of the consultations in the lead up to the <a href=\"https://www.worldhumanitariansummit.org/\">World Humanitarian Summit</a> in 2016, the <a href=\"http://www.un.org/esa/ffd/\">Financing for Development</a> consultations, and the UN Secretary-General\u2019s High-Level Panel on Humanitarian Financing.</p><h3><strong>Format of the workshop</strong></h3><p>Panellists will discuss current trends, challenges and opportunities in humanitarian financing \u2013 namely localising response and ensuring access to flexible, predictable funding in acute crises \u2013 while also speaking about the opportunities afforded by global agendas to reform humanitarian financing.</p><p>Breakout groups will focus on the following issues</p><ol>\n<li>Nationalising and Localising Humanitarian Response</li>\n<li>The Development and Humanitarian Nexus</li>\n<li>Embracing diversity to ensure sufficient humanitarian funding</li>\n<li>Moving towards a proactive ways of working to better meet peak demands</li>\n<li>Upgrading the Humanitarian Architecture to address inefficiencies and strengthen needs-based funding.</li>\n</ol><p>The outcome of these discussions will feed into the ECOSOC High-Level Panel discussion on humanitarian financing as well as into relevant global processes.</p><p>Opening remarks will be given by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p><p><strong>Key note speech: </strong>Kyung-wha Kang, Under-Secretary-General and Emergency Relief Coordinator (OCHA)</p><p><strong>Chair:\u00a0</strong>Anke Reiffenstuel, Deputy Head Task Force Humanitarian Aid, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Germany</p><p><strong>Panellists</strong></p><ul>\n<li>Sophia Swithern, Global Humanitarian Assistance (GHA) Programme Manager</li>\n<li>Lydia Poole (FHF)</li>\n<li>Robert Piper, UN Deputy Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process &amp; UN Regional Humanitarian Coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territories (oPt)</li>\n<li>Claus Sorenson, Director General, ECHO</li>\n<li>Thomas Gass, Assistant Secretary-General for Policy Coordination and Inter-Agency Affairs in UN DESA</li>\n<li>Fatou Diagne Zaouini, Risk Management Advisor, Africa Risk Capacity</li>\n</ul><p>Please follow the event on Twitter at #2015HF and follow the report discussion at #GHA2015</p><p>\u00a0</p>"}, {"title": "Webinar: Understanding ODA loans", "date": "", "time": "", "location": "", "format": "Event", "description": "Event: Understanding ODA loans: a growing source of development financing Date: June 24, 2015 9.00am-10.00am BST Location: Online The use of loans as a mec", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/understanding-oda-loans-a-growing-source-of-development-financing/", "body": "<p>9.00am-10.00am BST</p><p><strong>Location:</strong> Online</p><p>The use of loans as a mechanism for delivering development assistance has been an increasing trend in recent years, with the rise in ODA loans growing much faster than the rise in ODA grants.

However, this growth has not translated into commensurate poverty reduction or an improvement in the lives of the most poor. The <a href=\"http://www.ug.undp.org/content/uganda/en/home/presscenter/articles/2014/12/08/uganda-poverty-status-report-2014-launched.html\">2014 Poverty Status Report</a> in Uganda shows that despite stable growth the combined number of Ugandans that are either poor or vulnerable to poverty is 63% of the population, or 21.4 million. The broad-based growth agenda of Uganda differs from a pro-poor growth approach such as that adopted by Tanzania, which offers better prospects for the poor and vulnerable.</p><p>In both countries there is a case for financing social protection programmes to safeguard the poorest populations. (ii)\u00a0As part of the <strong>UNICEF speaker\u2019s series on financing social protection</strong> in these two countries, it was highlighted that finding fiscal space for social protection programmes was an important policy priority.</p><p>In the case of Uganda, analysis of fiscal space involved identifying additional revenue sources to bolster the country\u2019s ability to pay. This involves increasing the scope and effectiveness of existing revenue sources. Key questions to be considered include: is further investment in social protection affordable and feasible? Are social protection investments feasible in light of budget deficits and low revenue collection? Is social protection sustainable given the large number of dependents among Uganda\u2019s population? (iii)</p><p>Meanwhile in Tanzania tax revenue analysis suggests broadening the tax base and reducing tax exemptions and tax evasion rates. Specifically, tax exemptions need to be more pro-poor, tax evasion needs to be countered through stricter legislation, and additional tax revenue sources such as airspace tax could be explored.</p><p>Fundamental to financing social protection in both Tanzania and Uganda is the political commitments by policy makers to find the fiscal space that will resource these programmes. Social protection should be seen as investment rather than expenditure to lift the most vulnerable people out of extreme poverty by 2030.</p><p>\u00a0</p>"}, {"title": "High-Level Conference on the Data Revolution in Africa: Defining the next steps for data communities", "date": "", "time": "", "location": "", "format": "Event", "description": "This is a conference that was unique in many aspects.

Survey results led to 15 \u2018<a href=\"http://www.uneca.org/sites/default/files/page_attachments/program_and_procedural_notes_for_the_high-level_conference_on_data_revolution.pdf\">data communities</a>\u2019 being created: groups with common interests related to the objectives of the data revolution.

The main outcome of the meeting was a vision and set of principles shared with a group of organisations across the continent and with the conference organisers.</p><p>As a convenor of the Development Data Community, DI drafted a paper responding to a set of questions presented by organisers and shared this with over 50 stakeholders across the continent for input. Their feedback was compiled into a final draft shared with organisers, other communities, and tabled on the first day of the conference on 27 March as the official Development Data community paper for deliberation and further input. DI invited Mr Alex Ezeh, Executive Director at APHRC, and Dr. Bitange Ndemo, former Permanent Secretary in the ICT Ministry in Kenya, among other high profile individuals, to join community discussions and further enrich the paper. Pleasantly surprising, the organisers did not have a draft Africa Data Consensus document before the meeting and relied on the communities\u2019 input for content \u2013 perhaps a first for this nature of conference. We also discovered there were no separate meeting rooms for the communities, and we had to find space within the conference room for the discussions.

It further proposed that National Statistics Development Strategy encompass all activities relating to collecting data and compiling statistics.</p><p>The paper further emphasised the important<strong> role of development data in driving evidence-based development decision making</strong>. Beyond monitoring development the community recognised the need for development data to drive development. Decision-makers therefore need usable information based on data that is disaggregated down to the local level and is both timely and accurate. Those who hold them to account also need this information (and the data on which it is based) to be openly accessible. The community was happy that most of its <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e_Dqk8a8H1VhhJLPzOFFUUIrL6TxWDmoqmvAJBz-yYE/edit\">recommendations</a> were taken on board in the final consensus document.</p><p>Speaking during the event, Mr Charles Lwanga-Ntale, DI Africa Regional Director, also a member of the High-Level Panel that adopted the consensus document, said that the Data Revolution was not going to be achieved just for the sake of it, but had a clear purpose to help Africa achieve higher level goals. He cautioned against the revolution getting consumed by technicalities and technology, missing the real targets \u2013 ordinary people. He further emphasised the centrality of development data in the poverty eradication agenda of the continent, calling on stakeholders to actively promote national level initiatives that could leverage effective partnerships.</p><div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_8407\" style=\"width: 565px\"><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/High-Level-Conference-on-the-Data-Revolution-in-Africa-1.jpg\"><img alt=\"The Community and Citizen Data community (foreground) organised by Hivos East Africa and other communities engage their members during the conference\" class=\"size-large wp-image-8407\" height=\"370\" sizes=\"(max-width: 555px) 100vw, 555px\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/High-Level-Conference-on-the-Data-Revolution-in-Africa-1-555x370.jpg\" srcset=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/High-Level-Conference-on-the-Data-Revolution-in-Africa-1-555x370.jpg 555w, http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/High-Level-Conference-on-the-Data-Revolution-in-Africa-1-320x212.jpg 320w\" width=\"555\"/></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Community and Citizen Data community (foreground) organised by Hivos East Africa and other communities engage their members during the conference</p></div><h3></h3><h3><strong>Charting the way forward: Data Revolution for Africa</strong></h3><p>On the last day of the conference (30 March), DI was tasked by community members to convene a stakeholders\u2019 meeting to reflect on the immediate outcomes of the conference, find practical ways to engage beyond the conference, and forge a loose network to share materials, experiences and ideas. A steering committee was established comprising of individuals from INDEPTH Network-Ghana, ONE Campaign-South Africa, IPAR-Senegal, Center for Democratic Development-Ghana, Hivos East Africa-Kenya, and Development Initiatives Africa Hub-Kenya. Each organisation was tasked to lead regional engagements and draw more institutions that were not part of the High-Level Conference. A series of meetings and intense discussions are currently underway. A Google Group (Data Revolution for Africa) has been created to facilitate engagements. The key action points in the consensus document are providing direction, and guiding country level engagements on the Data Revolution in the lead up to the Third International Conference on Financing for Development to be held in Addis Ababa in July 2015.</p><h3><strong>Implementing the African Data Revolution in Kenya</strong></h3><p>At the national level in Kenya, DI is partnering with Hivos East Africa, other like-minded organisations and partners from government, civil society, media and private sector among others, \u00a0to explore how their comparative advantages can be leveraged to \u201cdomesticate, develop and test a local Data Revolution model\u201d at the national, and more importantly, the granular sub-national (county) level in Kenya. This process will be documented to yield a replicable model that could be shared across the region and the world.

We want to see re-commitment at the highest political levels to ending extreme poverty by 2030, using all available resources to do so, including domestic resources where they are available. We recommend a refocusing of ODA on ending poverty, tightening its current broad mandate.

Bolsa Fam\u00edlia is a component of the income pillar, along with other targeted transfers.

They vary according to national priorities and conditions.</p><p>Countries where poverty is still\u00a0 prevalent may focus on measures that improve the situation in the short term, such as Bolsa Fam\u00edlia. Countries where income poverty is already falling may want to look at more comprehensive approaches that include programmes for income generation and improving access to public services, such as the Brasil sem Mis\u00e9ria.</p><p>Countries could also learn from the current challenges that Brazil faces in order to better plan their own approach. The World without Poverty panellists suggested that further steps for Brazil should include improvements to the labour market, public services and public management, and should foster social participation.</p><p>Other countries may have similar challenges as well as good solutions to share.

A mother will know whether a school feeding programme is having an effect on her child, and lorry drivers are aware of road infrastructure issues. This idea that citizens can be the ones generating evidence led to DRT and DI partnering in 2011 to work on resource tracking in northern Uganda.</p><p><strong>Three years\u2019 work in northern Uganda: how feedback can have impact</strong></p><p>Resource trackers are selected by their community and trained by DRT. They are volunteers who gather feedback from their fellow citizens on the resources reaching their community and the responsiveness of these resources to their needs. Trackers take this information back to local government officials and other decision makers. This feedback provides evidence to the government on which resources are reaching communities and if these resources are meeting needs.</p><p>For example, resource trackers in the Gulu district identified a broken bridge as a key issue constraining their community\u2019s movements and safety. Trackers fed back to local government on the state of the bridge, followed-up for several months to ensure allocation of resources for reconstruction of the bridge, and monitored procurement and construction processes. When the trackers observed the contractor using sub-standard materials for constructing the bridge, they notified the local government. By developing a closed feedback loop with local government, trackers were able to ensure that resources were meeting the needs of their community: the bridge is now functional.</p><p>As detailed in our <a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Africa-Evidence-Network-paper.pdf\"><em>Using resource tracking and feedback to enhance accountability and resource effectiveness</em> report</a>, published in November 2014, through feedback loops between decision makers and citizens, evidence can be shared in a way that empowers citizen to voice their needs and track how they are being met. Feedback loops also enable governments to use citizen feedback as evidence for decision making. In the long term, this can strengthen the citizen\u2013government accountability relationship.</p><p><strong>Enhancing accountability: evidence and relationships both matter</strong></p><p>In order to extend the use of feedback as evidence, and encourage evidence-based policymaking, there is a need to promote:</p><ul>\n<li>Increased opportunities for citizens to feed back to decision makers through a range of channels</li>\n<li>Increased awareness and use of feedback as evidence among government and development partners</li>\n</ul><p>For evidence to be integrated into decision making, however, relationships are also key. Building connections and trust with policymakers is essential to ensure that evidence-informed policymaking becomes a reality across Africa. This is why DRT and DI work closely with local governments in northern Uganda. This is also why we engage at national and international levels. The Africa Evidence Network is therefore an important initiative to nourish relationships between policymakers, the research community and practitioners. DRT and DI look forward to working closely with network members.</p>"}, {"title": "The Global Context: Finance for Development", "date": "", "time": "", "location": "", "format": "Event", "description": "The Global Context: Finance for Development.

This aimed to create a realisation that all available resources need to be viewed holistically to better understand how they can work together to contribute to ending poverty n the country.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/mix-development-financing-instruments-country-like-uganda/", "body": "<p>Here are some of my key takeaways from the roundtable:</p><h2>We need to invest in better information to measure poverty in Uganda</h2><p>Uganda still relies on the 1992 national poverty line to measure the population proportions living in poverty. This has implications as the cost of living has changed and people may have fallen deeper into poverty, while others may be out. Not having the latest information on where poor people are also affects how we decide to allocate resources to better target development finance and to better assess its impact. It will be essential to invest in disaggregated, up-to-date, sub-national data on where poverty exists if Uganda is to target financing and policy effort at ending poverty.</p><h2>Uganda could improve targeting of financial resources on poverty</h2><p>Besides increasing resource allocation to the development of the various sectors in the economy, domestic resources must focus on human capital development \u2013 improving education and quality of life \u2013 to lead to improved outcomes. Taxes contribute over 60% of the country\u2019s domestic revenue, but there is a feeling in the country that taxes should be evaded. Instead tax payers should view tax as a means of demanding accountability from government.</p><p>Remittances are seen to be on the increase, especially in times of crisis, as they act as safety nets. But Uganda does not yet have a policy framework to regulate remittances. The transactions costs are also high, which could mean people may opt for informal means to transfer money.</p><p>While microfinance is always seen as the nearest instrument to the poor, it only manages to reach the economically active poor who mainly reside in the urban areas. Microfinance in Uganda has also been skewed to supporting women. So then for financing to lead to development, instruments like microfinance need to reach the very poor, the rural areas and target men too, avoiding gender disparity.</p><p>Microfinance needs to have various financial products such as agriculture financing, health insurance and education. But there is also need to develop systematic ways of managing social performances, for example, are poor people moving out of debt through microfinance institutions? More evidence is needed on the impacts of microfinance and how different policy responses and financial instruments fit together to provide a coherent pathway for people who receive microfinance, to ensure they do not just move back into poverty again.</p><h2>International actors could support Uganda to target financial efforts at ending poverty through\u2026</h2><h4>More effective official development assistance (ODA)</h4><p>More effective ODA means improving its value for money and focusing on the bottom of the pyramid, where poor people are. ODA could be re-examined by Uganda and donor partners in the national context to make sure it is being used according to its strengths and having the most impact on poverty.</p><h4>Donors in the DAC group and other providers coordinating efforts</h4><p>Roundtable attendees felt that donors in Uganda need to harmonise and coordinate their efforts. There needs to be reconciliation between the ODA donors in the DAC group and other providers such as China. It is felt that discussions on the Global Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation (GPEDC) through the Paris, Accra, Busan and the latest Mexico commitments, will only be fully implemented when donors in the DAC group and other providers sit at the same table.</p><h4>Investments in agriculture banks</h4><p>Agriculture is the backbone of Uganda, so investments in agriculture banks to increase access to finance are vital. Value addition on agriculture produce must be prioritised for agriculture to generate higher revenues.</p><p>In sum, participants at the roundtable agreed it is time that people in Uganda started looking at development financing instruments as a whole, and not only focusing on ODA and what can be traced through the national budgets. Ugandans must be aware that there is much more that can be done with the other instruments to pull people out of poverty. One good way of doing this is creating forums where people can access information on the various instruments and discuss ways to improve these.</p><p><em>Africacounts roundtables are multi-stakeholder forums designed to stimulate constructive dialogue and effective partnerships amongst civil society, media, government and academia to influence resource allocation and prioritisation of poverty eradication in the East African region.</em></p>"}, {"title": "Watch Judith Randel's presentation to UN Development Cooperation Forum 2014", "date": "", "time": "", "location": "", "format": "Event", "description": "Judith Randel, UNDCF 2014.

The result is that open data has at least joined the majority of development discussions at government fora and key institutions like Uganda Bureau of Statistics and The Kenya ICT board and the Ministries of Finance of the two governments are now our key partners. We also were able to leverage the opportunity the study gave to enrich our other projects with similar goals.</p><p>Our key finding is that although there was no clear link between open data and resource allocation, largely because of political economy factors, digital divide, policy incoherence among other factors, the potential for this link is apparent because of equally strong drivers of open data processes in both countries.</p><p>The dissemination event was graced by The Hon.

With representation from the community, national and global levels, the meeting aimed to be a small step in connecting the dots and developing a shared understanding of the challenges of making the Data Revolution a reality in Kenya. The discussion was guided by three fundamental questions</p><ul>\n<li>What needs to be done to make the Data Revolution a reality for Kenya and Kenyans?</li>\n<li>What is the best way to make connections and links among different stakeholders?</li>\n<li>What role could organisations play in ensuring that the \u2019demand\u2019 and \u2019supply\u2019 sides of data and information at national, sub-national and community levels communicate effectively and help connect the dots?</li>\n</ul><p>The key points made by attendees are outlined below, but all of them point to the Data Revolution in Kenya being more than a challenge of improving data and ensuring that the data is both relevant and accessible. The Data Revolution needs to be piloted by a multi-stakeholder group to enable different stakeholders to find ways of working together and sharing information to focus on ending poverty.</p><p>This was the second meeting on the Data Revolution hosted by Development Initiatives (the first one was held in <a href=\"http://devinit.org/data-revolution-end-poverty/\">2013</a>). We hope that these meetings will be part of a continuing conversation and look forward to working with colleagues across the region to ensure that the Data Revolution really does result in improved lives for the poorest in East Africa.</p><h3>Key points</h3><h4>What needs to be done in order to make the Data Revolution a reality (and of maximum benefit) for Kenya and Kenyans?</h4><p>Data may be broadly divided into two groups \u2013 \u2018core data\u2019 and a \u2018symphony of data\u2019. Core data is the traditional data that is produced mainly by governments, but we also have what is the \u2018symphony\u2019 data \u2013 this is new data that come with tech solutions. The core data needs to be open and accessible to trigger analysis. The symphony of data also needs to speak to the challenges that the country is facing \u2013 it requires going beyond developing applications.</p><p>When you talk about data in Kenya, we first look at techies. But we want situations where we also engage the non-techies. We need to take the risk and move out of the urban areas \u2013where discussions on data, transparency and accountability are vibrant \u2013 and go down to community levels.</p><p>Data needs to be made relevant to people at all levels, and making sure this is always cascaded. People at the local level need highly disaggregated data. Besides aggregating this data, literacy levels of the people at the ground need to be enhanced to lead to well informed public participation and engagement.</p><p>The intermediaries and mediums that we use to bring information should vary too. Some people have more confidence in their religious leaders, some fear their political leaders. How do we make use of this?</p><p>Ultimately, there is also the need to look beyond data and put in place proper legislative systems such as passing the Access to Information Act to promote data access.</p><h3></h3><h4>What is the best way to make connections and links among different stakeholders in the Data Revolution?</h4><p>Kenya needs to be more strategic, and find champions to support the Data Revolution. This may require champions both at the national level but also at the local level. Monetary incentives for the Data Revolution most of the time does not come up in discussions. How do we put money into the Data Revolution and work with organisations that are for-profit to make the best use of data?</p><h3></h3><h4>What role could organisations play in ensuring that the \u2018demand\u2019 and \u2018supply\u2019 sides of data and information at national, sub-national and community levels communicate effectively and help connect the dots?</h4><p>First an understanding that the Data Revolution has to be driven by something is fundamental. What is that target that we want? Ultimately the Data Revolution needs to drive the end of poverty.</p><p>Kenya needs a multi-stakeholder group piloting how the Data Revolution can be done; this will then be replicated at the grassroots, which may be organised in thematic working groups. The stakeholder groups need to talk collectively and find ways of working together and sharing information. In addition, we need to use the data that is already available to create demand for better or more data.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p>"}, {"title": "Event: Private funding of humanitarian aid: is this the future?", "date": "", "time": "", "location": "", "format": "Event", "description": "Join our panel event to launch Global Humanitarian Assistance Programme's latest study: Humanitarian Assistance from non-state donors- what's it worth?", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/event-private-funding-humanitarian-aid-future/", "body": "<h4>Venue:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.odi.org.uk/events/3931-humanitarian-assistance-funded-by-private-sector-event\">Overseas Development Institute</a> and streamed live online</h4><p>Private giving from individuals, foundations and corporations\u00a0is an increasingly important source of funding for humanitarian assistance.

All investments \u2013 domestic and international, public, private and commercial \u2013 can contribute to ending poverty.\u00a0 Some will deliver immediate returns; other investments will deliver longer term impact.

Implementation and progress on social protection differs across African states</b></p><p>Whilst countries across the continent have made significant progress in building institutions, and establishing policy and legislative frameworks for facilitating programming and financing of social protection, there are marked disparities and differences in how this is progressing, and how policies are being implemented. Countries represented in this conference were at different levels of legislation in social protection policy, planning and programming.\u00a0 For example, in Rwanda, the state budget law already stipulates that 5% of all domestic revenues be allocated to social protection programmes. Kenya recently passed social protection policy aimed at centralising all social protection initiatives (be it humanitarian interventions, asset building and productivity enhancing interventions in agriculture, or education). Some representatives of certain countries (like Uganda or Ethiopia) mentioned the need for\u00a0<b>strengthening coordination</b> between departments in charge of different social protection programmes. (This issue was highlighted in the recent <a href=\"http://devinit.org/economic-growth-wont-enough-help-ugandas-poorest/\">Uganda Chronic Poverty report,</a> which calls for more coherent cross-government working on SP.)</p><p><b>2. Effective SP policies could \u00a0leverage economic growth</b></p><p>The idea that social protection discourse in Africa could be usefully viewed through a <b>human rights perspective</b> was also explored during the conference. It was argued by some attendees that the perception of social protection may need to change, in recognition of the capacity of social protection policies to drive economic growth- for example, successful SP interventions can increase consumption and production. Prof. Jimi Adesina\u2019s presentation demonstrated that social protection should perhaps move away from just \u201cex-post\u201d responses to vulnerability, and concentrate on \u201cex-ante\u201d, fundamental human rights-focused policies, which could prevent and mitigate shocks.</p><p>It was also argued that the way forward for SP policies might be to focus on simple, tested interventions, and progressively build on them, rather than launching ambitious programmes with large resource outlays. The latter require substantial political will behind them to sustain their place on the policy agenda, and risk being abandoned; whereas the former can help build an evidence base for scaling up.\u00a0 Marianne Uriksen\u2019s presentation at the conference was a look at South Africa and Mauritius\u2019 long history of tax financed social protection programmes. Her presentation demonstrated examples of tax-financed social protection programmes, schemes in countries such as Mauritius, South Africa and Rwanda, which have made commendable progress, and may now be up-scaled.</p><p><b>3. Natural resource revenues could be invested in social protection</b></p><p>There was a good discussion about how domestic resources can contribute to financing for SP. \u00a0Many felt that natural resource rents currently emerging in the region, and domestic resources that have been exploited before, could be effectively leveraged to fund social protection, and wean the sector off over-reliance on external resources. (ODA is a key external resource which often funds social protection programmes).\u00a0It was, however, noted that Africa countries must draw a balance \u2013 to ensure that natural resource revenues are invested both in infrastructure and in social development initiatives. While countries often place upfront importance on investing in infrastructure assets (such as roads), the future usability of these assets will also depend on investments in sustainable social development. EG: Building livelihoods through SP policies could promote use of transport links- through giving people more disposable income, and encouraging local trade and commerce.</p><h4>What\u2019s next for social protection in East Africa?</h4><p>Although social protection has gained significance in national development policy, and is increasingly on the agenda in debates on resource allocation across the African continent, the conference concluded that further pressure on national governments is still needed: to call for more resources to be allocated to social protection. There are still high numbers of poor people in sub-Saharan Africa (and globally) who are bypassed both by the benefits of economic growth and traditional development interventions. Failure to address this, will entrench another generation in extreme poverty \u2013 who are unable to move out of the poverty trap, and whose children will likely enter the same state.</p><p>The Kampala conference will inform future research work; DI and DRT, together with partners like EPRC, are working to generate new knowledge which can inform social protection policies and programmes. We also continue to engage policymakers in East Africa on minimum social protection provisions such as the national social protection floor, and a key\u00a0 upcoming focus for DI/DRT research is \u2018safety nets\u2019, (comprehensive social protection systems). Our upcoming <a href=\"http://devinit.org/east-africa-chronic-poverty-report-pipeline/\">East Africa Chronic Poverty</a> report, will also explore these issues further.</p>"}, {"title": "Event: Nov 21 - Round Table on basic education in Kenya", "date": "", "time": "", "location": "", "format": "Event", "description": "Development Initiatives Africa Hub is convening the next Africacounts Roundtable Forum in Nairobi for education sector stakeholders in November.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/event-nov-21-round-table-basic-education-kenya/", "body": "<ul>\n<li>Discuss access to information and management of resources for basic education in Kenya</li>\n<li>Interrogate the rise in teacher absenteeism in Kenya and explore mechanisms for dealing with it</li>\n<li>Explore prospects of the one laptop per child programme for improving learning outcomes</li>\n</ul><p>The forum aims to track progress in basic education and explore mechanisms for leveraging accountability to improve access to and quality of basic education in the country.</p><h3>To attend:</h3><p>Please register on Eventbrite <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/enhancing-accountability-and-learning-outcomes-in-basic-education-in-kenya-tickets-6239930801\">here.</a></p><h3>Background information</h3><p>Despite receiving one of the largest outlays of public resources over the past decade, (average 18% of total government spending), basic education performance in Kenya has remained unsatisfactory (Rono, 2012). Evidence adduced by Uwezo Kenya (2012) indicates that learning outcomes are low; 7 out of 10 children in class 3 cannot do Class 2 work and over 10% of children in Class 8 cannot do simple class 2 mathematics.</p><p>Research by <a href=\"http://www.nta.or.ke/\">National Taxpayers Association</a> (NTA) has also shown that parental involvement and performance of school management committees among others have a direct bearing on learning outcomes (NTA, 2012). Beyond increments in enrolment and teacher-pupil ratios, the education system appears largely\u00a0 exam-centric, characterised by memorisation and regurgitation, and devoid of creativity, critical thought and complex reasoning that is more useful for innovation (Abagi, 2013; Awiti, 2013). Little emphasis is put on inculcation of practical skills necessary for economic development (KIE, 2010).</p><p>Stakeholders in the education sector in Kenya argue that a lot of the inadequacies and underperformance in the sector is largely attributable to insufficient accountability. In fact, there is increasing empirical evidence indicating that for education service delivery to improve outcomes in literacy and to enhance other positive externalities crucial for driving economic growth and poverty reduction, the issue of accountability must be aptly addressed (Kimenyi, 2012). Dessy, Nannyonjo and Vencatachellum (2012) established in their study on service delivery reforms in Africa that government spending does not necessarily translate into better outcomes. Oriakhi (2006) established that in Nigeria, despite allocation of large amounts of resources to education, satisfactory outcomes were still elusive in the absence of effective accountability mechanisms.</p><p><strong>About this event\u00a0</strong></p><p><img alt=\"|Kenya \" class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-1928\" height=\"180\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/DSC02193-300x180.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;\" width=\"300\"/></p><p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/about/africa-hub/\" title=\"The Africa Hub\">Development Initiatives\u00a0\u2013 Africa Hub</a> holds the\u00a0<strong><em>Africacounts</em></strong><em>\u00a0</em>round tables.

Blog by Kenn Okwaroh", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/kenn-okwaroh-identifies-4-key-takeaways-recent-africacounts-round-table-forum-took-place-nairobi/", "body": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Earlier this month, we convened one of our regular #<a href=\"http://devinit.org/event-devolution-kenyas-health-sector/\">Africacounts round table forums</a> for health sector stakeholders, to discuss the challenges and potential opportunities around devolving healthcare. Participants explored three key areas:</p><ol>\n<li>Prioritisation and resource allocation for health</li>\n<li>Openness in health care service delivery and</li>\n<li>Sustainability of health systems.</li>\n</ol><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Below, we outline the four key learnings and the overarching message which we took away from the event.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">1. There is need for further discussion and debate on defining \u2018health as a right\u2019</h3><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Stakeholders emphasised the need to refer to the relevant sections of the constitution and supporting legislation on devolution, and in particular, the sections that enshrine health as a right, as a first step towards ensuring that devolution works. Participants identified an urgent need for clarity in defining what the <a href=\"http://www.cickenya.org/images/downloads/Constitution/The_Constitution_of_Kenya_2010.pdf\">constitution</a> implies in its provision for the right to health.</p><blockquote>\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\u201cHow will you measure achievement without agreeing on what the right to health entails?\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://www.cickenya.org/\">Catherine Mumma, Commission for the Implementation of the Constitution</a></p>\n</blockquote><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Agreeing on a definition of what the \u2018right to health\u2019 entails will create shared expectations which will, in turn, ensure standardisation, policy harmonisation, and costing, as well as resource allocation. It will also enable monitoring by the people and reduce the likelihood of unequal provision within and between counties</p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">2. Open Governance provides an opportunity to enhance accountability and improve healthcare service delivery</h3><p style=\"text-align: left;\">If available in the right level of detail, open data on healthcare services could empower health sector stakeholders to demand accountability and keep county governments accountable for effective service delivery. Opening up data/information (on resource flows, services, morbidity, disease trajectories), will enhance meaningful citizen participation in decision making and bolster accountability.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">However outside the big cities, Kenya will probably lack enough \u2018infomediaries\u2019 (or data interpreters), who are necessary to transform \u2018big data\u2019 into formats that citizens can consume and understand. Challenges in harmonising and integrating new and old data management systems, building skills and capacity, and historical reluctance to share government data, are key issues that county health stakeholders will need to contend with in making meaningful use of open data. \u00a0<a href=\"http://blogs.worldbank.org/team/wolfgang-fengler\">Wolfgang Fengler</a> notes: \u201cIf not managed well, decentralization may lead to greater inequality [in Kenya]. Some counties will start at a relative disadvantage \u2026they will be the least equipped in practice to make efficient and transparent use of their resources\u201d</p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">3.\u00a0Counties should explore resource streams beyond national government allocations</h3><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Participants envisage potential conflicts between the national and devolved governments with regards to the division and allocation of resources. Due to divergence in health systems, resource endowments and demand for health care, priority setting and resource allocations are bound to vary across counties. Maintaining standards, with the inherent inequalities that exist, will thus be tricky. Nonetheless, participants brainstormed and suggested a reasonable range of alternative funding that county governments could pursue. These include:</p><ul>\n<li>National government disbursements, as stipulated in the revenue sharing laws,</li>\n<li>External/extra budgetary resource streams like grants and loans,</li>\n<li>Localised/community based health insurance schemes</li>\n<li>Efficiently managed public-private partnerships and</li>\n<li>User fees/cost sharing</li>\n</ul><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">4.\u00a0For better use of health resources: invest more in preventative measures</h3><blockquote>\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: left;\">\u201cNo matter how lean and efficient a healthcare system, it cannot be sustainable unless growing demand for healthcare is slowed\u201d</p>\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_SustainableHealthSystems_Report_2013.pdf\">World Economic Forum, 2013</a></p>\n</blockquote><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Global focus is shifting towards developing \u2018sustainable health systems\u2019. Participants urged the Kenyan government to consider policies that nurture healthy societies and reduce demand for healthcare. Currently, it was felt, Kenyan health policies overemphasise responsive and curative healthcare service delivery at the expense of preventive programmes. In order to succeed in providing quality and sustainable healthcare services, the county health systems must work instead towards reducing the burden of disease. To make better use of resources, counties should invest more in addressing the underlying causes of illnesses and infections that demand huge expenditures of public funds.</p><blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\u201cWe must observe the correlation between the environment, nutrition and health. Most of the health cases that doctors deal with in Kenya are largely preventive\u201d</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http://akibauhaki.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=154:kenyans-for-justice-and-development-kejude&amp;catid=33:social-justice-philanthropy-&amp;Itemid=181\">Okiya Omtata, Kejude Trust</a></p>\n</blockquote><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">An ongoing process</h3><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The overarching message from the forum was that<b> </b>devolution is an unfinished, ongoing process with many challenges, but also many opportunities for greater accountability for service delivery if properly executed. It must involve a constant search for the most efficient balance between centralised steering and county-level autonomy.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">We believe that some responsibility lies with the citizens in effectively devolving the health function in Kenya. Health sector stakeholders must temper their expectations with pragmatism, and be proactive, working with others in the sector to keep monitoring progress and hold their counties accountable for the provision of health care service delivery that they need.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>For further consultations and information on this forum, please contact:\u00a0 Kenn.Okwaroh@devinit.org |Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Okwaroh\">@Okwaroh</a>.

Participants shared their experiences on the push for open and transparent institutions, accountable to the people, and brainstormed ideas on how the global OGP could respond. Discussions focused on: the role of big data, public statistics, analytics and technology\u2019s role in improving service delivery; managing extractive industries to ensure processes are open, transparent, participatory and accountable; and how to leverage technology and the media to bolster citizen engagement and enhance public integrity.</p><h3>Key issues emerging from the discussions included:</h3><ul>\n<li>Inadequate understanding of the concept of open governance in Africa;</li>\n<li>The absence of strong champions for the agenda;</li>\n<li>The impact of technocratic language used by OGP practitioners and how it fails to resonate with people at local level;</li>\n<li>The lack of engagement among\u00a0African leaders/governments and failure to share experiences;</li>\n<li>The apparent overlap in governance monitoring mechanisms (OGP, African Union and United Nations, African Peer Review Mechanism etc ) and how this could be stifling progress;</li>\n<li>The need to explore both supply and demand side issues in scaling up OGP;</li>\n<li>The quality of information coming through existing open governance platforms;</li>\n<li>The inadequate engagement of African legislatures and private sector who have great influence, political muscle and interest in good governance in the continent.</li>\n</ul><p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/OGP.jpg\"><img alt=\"OGP\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2555\" height=\"132\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/OGP.jpg\" width=\"600\"/></a></p><h3>The Civil Society/Government disconnect</h3><p>Participants made the point that success of the OGP depends largely on trust and cooperation between government and civil society. Nonetheless, deliberations over the two-day conference illustrated the clear tension between government and CSOs that must be addressed if we are to achieve meaningful progress.</p><p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Kaburo.jpg\"><img alt=\"Kaburo\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2556\" height=\"123\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Kaburo.jpg\" width=\"584\"/></a></p><p>There is currently a clear disconnect between the motivations, intentions and expectations of civil society and those of government, despite both working towards the common good of the citizen. Much work related to open governance appears to be taking place in silos with little coordination, mutual awareness and strategy. Though the need for effective partnerships between government and CSOs was emphasised, participants cautioned against very cosy relationships that create complacency and that could potentially jeopardise the watchdog role played by civil society.</p><p><a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Jason.jpg\"><img alt=\"Jason\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2557\" height=\"121\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Jason.jpg\" width=\"574\"/></a></p><p align=\"center\">\u201cThe era of sloganeering, CSO obstruction, political activism is gone [\u2026] CSOs must reorient and repackage their engagement with government [\u2026 they] must begin to perceive themselves as partners with government\u201d \u2013 (Fred Matiang\u2019i, Cabinet Secretary for ICT \u2013 Kenya)</p><p>\u00a0It is our view that the African OGP steering committee must support states and civil society to collaborate with sufficient space for objective and constructive CSO monitoring and feedback in the role of \u2018critical friend\u2019.

However, real success of the OGP will depend on implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the action plans developed by participating countries. Otherwise OGP membership risks being viewed as an end (utilised to score political mileage in the global political economy) rather than a means towards a greater goal of realising good governance and transparent and accountable government institutions.</p><p>We think that the OGP support unit must play an active role in monitoring participants to ensure they invest sufficiently in open governance, set realistic goals in their action plans, implement and accurately report on progress. Further, it must safeguard against monopolisation of the process by government (capable of overstating progress and being overambitious in planning) and minimising dialogue between CSOs and government. The African experience must, in turn, inform the wider movement.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p>"}, {"title": "Reflections on UK Parliament nutrition event", "date": "", "time": "", "location": "", "format": "Event", "description": "Coverage of DI's presentation of 'The Aid Financing Landscape for Nutrition' report at the All Party Parliamentary Group's event on nutrition.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/reflections-uk-parliament-nutrition-event/", "body": "<h3>DI presents nutrition report</h3><p>DI\u2019s involvement was primarily to present the recently published, \u2018<a href=\"http://devinit.org/report/the-aid-financing-landscape-for-nutrition/\">The Aid Financing Landscape for Nutrition</a>\u2019.

Following a large increase in 2009, ODA to basic nutrition fell by 25% in 2010 and increased by only 3% from 2010 to 2011.</li>\n<li>Under-nutrition is concentrated in 36 countries and overall ODA targets them well \u2013 72% of basic nutrition ODA funding goes to these countries where 90% of the world\u2019s stunted children live.</li>\n<li>However, at a regional and country level, there are disparities between the distribution of ODA and financial need. Financial needs are higher in South Asia, which requires 56% of additional investments (mostly due to India being home to the highest number of stunted children). However, South Asia as a region receives only 28% of basic nutrition ODA. Conversely, sub-Saharan Africa represents 26% of financial need and receives 54% of aid.</li>\n</ul><div class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" style=\"width: 310px\"><a href=\"http://www.devinit.org/archivedsite/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0101.jpg\"><img alt=\"nutrition\" height=\"210\" src=\"http://www.devinit.org/archivedsite/wp-content/uploads/DSC_0101-300x210.jpg\" width=\"300\"/></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hannah Corbett, IDS</p></div><h3>Donor commitment to nutrition</h3><p>We also heard from Lawrence Haddad who talked about the launch of the Institute for Development Studies\u2019 (IDS)\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.ids.ac.uk/project/hunger-and-nutrition-commitment-index-hanci\">Hunger And Nutrition Commitment Index (HANCI)</a>. The index measures a wide range of factors to determine overall political commitment of donor countries to tackling hunger and under-nutrition. Lawrence explained that the aim of the HANCI is to provide transparency around donor countries\u2019 nutrition commitments. Lawrence rightly emphasised that a donor\u2019s commitment to nutrition should not only be measured by their funding commitments but also by other measurements such as their protection of domestic agricultural markets and the sensitivity of other aid programmes to nutrition. These factors can have a significant impact on helping recipient countries reduce hunger and under-nutrition.</p><p>Lawrence went on to praise the UK\u2019s Department for International Development (DfID) for helping to reduce under-nutrition, which is reflected in the UK scoring highest on the HANCI. Our report corroborates this \u2013 from 2006/07 to 2011/12 aid disbursed by DfID to basic nutrition interventions increased from \u00a32.2 million to \u00a337.5 million.</p><p>However, Lawrence also outlined some areas in which the UK could be doing better. His recommendations were not only to increase nutrition funding, but to ensure that a commitment to long-term funding is included in a post-2015 agreement. He recommended there should be more of a focus on reducing the causes of under-nutrition and that DfID should try to ensure it is fully leveraging its position as a global leader on issues on under-nutrition.</p><h3>Challenges facing developing nations<a href=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Aid.jpg\"><img alt=\"Aid\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-726 alignright\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://devinit.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Aid-225x300.jpg\" width=\"225\"/></a></h3><p>After hearing from Lawrence, Sandra Mutuma gave a presentation outlining the challenge that under-nutrition presents for developing countries. She described Action Against Hunger\u2019s (ACF) recommendations for the UK government\u2019s policies to help address the issue. \u00a0The 56 million children under 5 who are\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/stats_popup2.html\">wasted</a>\u00a0have a 9-10 times higher risk of death than a non-wasted child. Overall, in 35% of all deaths of children under 5 under-nutrition is an underlying cause. Even more troubling, according to ACF, of all the ODA that is recorded as basic nutrition interventions, roughly 50% has no relevance to reducing under-nutrition. Sandra echoed our report, pointing to the lack of funding.</p><p>She then moved on to discuss how to combat under-nutrition. 95% of DfID\u2019s basic nutrition funding is spent on therapeutic feeding, providing foods high in nutrition to starving people in emergency situations. While she recognised the importance of this, Sandra called for more focus on nutrition funding in a developmental context \u2013 preventing under-nutrition before it reaches crisis levels.</p><p>Another important issue raised was the need for flexibility of funding, as certain types of nutrition interventions result in high human resource and delivery costs. Traditionally, these have been funded by the recipient country \u2013 by addressing this and providing more flexible funding, recipient countries should be able to to cover these costs and better tackle under-nutrition.</p><p>Overall, the speakers emphasised the need for much higher levels of funding for nutrition interventions, particularly those that focus on preventing under-nutrition.\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-to-host-high-level-meeting-on-global-nutrition-and-growth\">The Nutrition for Growth: Beating Hunger through Business and Science summit</a>\u00a0on 8 June will provide a platform for continuing the push for nutrition to be included in the post-2015 agreement.

Cordelia Lonsdale comments on the party's strategy.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/uk-labour-partys-post-2015-vision/", "body": "<h3>Good governance core to post-2015</h3><p>Moving on to the Labour post-2015 vision, Lewis set out his stall with ten separate policy points (see link above; you can also read a lengthy analysis by Mark Tran in the Guardian\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2013/may/15/good-governance-poor-countries-labour\">here</a>). \u00a0They add up to a compelling vision, calling for the High Level Panel to focus on \u201cinequality, not simply poverty.\u201d DI especially welcomes the Shadow Secretary of State\u2019s call for good governance to be core to the post-2015 framework (see points 9 and 10). He notes that \u201ctargets should focus on developing quality and accessible data systems, access to information, civic education programmes.\u201d We broadly agree that in the post-2015 settlement, targets should focus on \u201ccorporate responsibility reporting, respect for legal frameworks and human rights that comply with international standards, access to justice and freedom from corruption.\u201d In fact, DI, along with partners such as Global Witness and the International Budget Partnership, have already begun working towards the tricky \u2018how\u2019 of such a set of targets. Our push to enshrine better governance and\u00a0access to information\u00a0in the post-2015 settlement is covered <a href=\"http://devinit.org/putting-access-information-center-post-2015/\" title=\"Putting access to information at the center of post-2015\">here</a>; setting out proposed goals and indicators on governance, transparency, and mainstreaming investment and outcome indicators.</p><h3>More needed on the \u2018how\u2019</h3><p>Though Lewis\u2019 speech was encouraging, some in the room felt that such detail on the \u2018how\u2019 was lacking. As David Nussbaum of Beyond 2015 noted in his response to Lewis on the day, Labour could especially be clearer in what mechanisms they will use for monitoring accountability in the post-2015 goals; DI noted particularly that Lewis made no explicit mention of either the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.opengovpartnership.org/\">Open Government Partnership</a>\u00a0or the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.aidtransparency.net/\">International Aid Transparency Initiative</a>\u00a0\u2013\u00a0though he did refer to IATI obliquely and in passing.</p><p>We would also like to encourage Mr Lewis to go further in his thinking on value for money. Though both transparency and empowerment of developing country citizens were separate themes in the Labour vision, it is possible to make more explicit the crucial links between the two issues. Greater transparency (for example, through the IATI and the momentum of the open government agenda) is not just the key to better accountability on aid spending from a domestic perspective. Through enabling citizens in aid recipient countries to understand and use information about aid, transparency can also be the key to\u00a0 ending what Lewis sees as \u2018dependency\u2019 but can also be called dis-empowerment; resulting in part from a lack of transparency around resources available for investment in poverty reduction. Drawing these links could help move the transparency debate on from talking about the domestic issue of \u2018value for money\u2019 \u2013\u00a0important though this is \u2013\u00a0and <a href=\"http://devinit.org/policy-briefings/data-revolution-poverty-eradication/\" title=\"A Data Revolution for Poverty Eradication\">focus more explicitly on the needs of poor people.\u00a0</a></p><h3>Better data for post-2015</h3><p>Lastly, Lewis makes a welcome call for \u201cQuality, accessible and dis-aggregated data\u201d on inequality and poverty, and rightly says that better data is of paramount importance to the post-2015 settlement. In fact, DI is highlighting the importance of this agenda through our\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/report/investments-to-end-poverty/\">Investments to End Poverty</a>\u00a0programme, which (in partnership with the Brookings Institution) seeks to view aid in the context of all resources, including remittances and FDI. Watch out for the next discussion paper in this series, which will focus on the\u00a0data we currently lack about poverty. How can we end poverty if we don\u2019t know who the poor are or where they live? Why is it so difficult to count the number of poor people in the world? Can household surveys accurately capture levels of inequality in a developing country? (Watch the\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/devinitorg\">@devinitorg</a>\u00a0twitter feed for this!) We look forward to engaging with others, including the Labour Campaign for International Development, on this important agenda in coming weeks. Meanwhile, as we wait for the release of the High Level Panel\u2019s report on May 30th, DI will continue to work with our partners to provide evidence for the Panel on the links between access to better information and the eradication of extreme poverty.</p><p>If you have questions or comments, please contact us on\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:info@devinit.org\">info@devinit.org</a>.</p>"}, {"title": "Focus on transparency: Open Working Group on SDGs", "date": "", "time": "", "location": "", "format": "Event", "description": "Development Initiatives are co-signing a letter to the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals highlighting the importance of transparency.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/open-working-group-sdgs-focus-transparency/", "body": "<h3>Calling for transparency and accountability</h3><p>Development Initiatives has co-signed a letter to the OWG on Sustainable Development Goals along with Integrity Action, International Budget Partnership, ONE, Publish What You Fund, Publish What You Pay UK, Tearfund and Transparency International.</p><p>In the letter we state our belief that transparency and accountability is an issue that must figure prominently if a transformational post-2015 framework for development is to be achieved.

The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were silent on implementation and, given rapid growth in the number of actors involved in international development (and the resources they control), the need for agreement on responsibilities and funding is greater now than ever. A framework that specifies the means of implementation should address how responsibilities can be shared among actors \u2013 public and private, national and international \u2013 and should look to increase the contributions that wider resources, such as remittances and foreign direct investment, make to the post-2015 goals. It is important that this imperative is not lost as the HLP process gives way to intergovernmental processes later in 2013 and beyond.</p><p>\u201cWe need a data revolution.\u201d (Bali HLP Communiqu\u00e9, p.3)</p><p>Good decision making relies on good data, and an inclusive and transformative agenda must be built on a detailed understanding of the circumstances faced by diverse groups across society. Without an accurate, disaggregated picture, policy making will naturally centre on the average, and this risks ignoring the circumstances of minorities or groups with distinct needs.</p><h3>Sustaining momentum</h3><p>The HLP have made a clear statement on the importance of high quality disaggregated data and it is important that this momentum is sustained. There is a long way to go before the statistical systems that we have today are able to produce the kind of information that can drive detailed and disaggregated evidence-based policy making. For example, we are not yet even able to reliably estimate $1.25 a day poverty measures at the national level annually or within a reasonable timeframe.</p><p>Clearly, significant investment is required if we are to reach a state where diverse social and economic indicators can be examined according to gender, age, race, health, sub-national location or other factors. Nevertheless, the panel have made an important statement and it is imperative that momentum around improving statistical systems is sustained \u2013 through investment in country systems, technical capacity, political prioritisation and funding.</p><p>For more information, please see\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/discussion-paper/discussion-paper-harnessing-resources/\">Harnessing all resources to end poverty</a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"http://devinit.org/an-open-goal-that-cant-be-missed-2015-and-open-data/\">An Open Goal: How to empower the post-2015 framework</a>,\u00a0or contact Tim Strawson (<a href=\"mailto:tim.strawson@devinit.org\">tim.strawson@devinit.org</a>) on harnessing all resources for poverty eradication and Andrew Palmer (<a href=\"mailto:andrew.palmer@devinit.org\">andrew.palmer@devinit.org</a>) on access to information.</p>"}, {"title": "More than just data: Kampala round table forum", "date": "", "time": "", "location": "", "format": "Event", "description": "The Kampala round table forum agrees that an open data platform would stimulate public demand for information in Uganda.", "url": "http://devinit.org/post/just-data-kampala-roundtable-forum/", "body": "<p>On Wednesday 13 March 2013 in Kampala,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.drt-ug.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Development Research and Training</a>\u00a0(DRT) and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.devinit.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Development Initiatives \u2013 Africa Hub</a>\u00a0organised an Africacounts round table forum on open development<strong>.\u00a0</strong>The Africacounts round tables are multi-stakeholder forums designed to stimulate constructive dialogue among civil society, media, government and academia.

In this day and age it is difficult to envision progress in Kenya without a responsive, efficient and accountable government informing citizens about its dealings on their behalf. This is what the architects of KODI had in mind when they were crafting it. Charles Lwanga-Ntale, Development Initiatives\u2019 Regional Director for Africa, argues that Kenya\u2019s approach in establishing KODI first, then beginning to work on the justification (policy/legal framework) later was probably better than Uganda\u2019s approach. This approach worked well for a country caught up in bureaucratic red tape and government infighting, which would have made it impossible to adopt an inclusive approach in establishing KODI given the acrimonious relationship between government and civil society. In comparison, Uganda has had the Freedom of Information Law since 2005 but real progress in availing public data and information has been more elusive.</p><p>Unfortunately, we are drawing tough lessons from the absence of a legal framework to safeguard KODI in Kenya. Speaker after speaker alluded to this as a fundamental weakness of KODI. Ms. Linet Kwamboka, Coordinator at Kenya Open Data Initiative admitted the lack of legislation compelling government bodies to release data to the public is holding back progress. The journey to a Freedom of Information Law has been long and winding since the first attempt to enact it in 2007 through a private members Bill. During the special session to analyse the draft Freedom of Information (FOI) and Data Protection Bills, Mr. Martin Oloo, a Nairobi based legal expert, highlighted the omissions and commissions that dilute and, in some instances, do not shed adequate light on the letter and spirit of the constitution. In particular, he sighted the provisions on Private Body and Public Officer, one-off provision for proactive disclosure, the absence of provisions entrenching KODI in FOI and requirements for public entities to deposit certain agreed information to an open portal in line with the principles of open government, among others. Participants provided valuable contributions on how the legal framework could be strengthened. A key highlight of the meeting was a request from the Commission on Implementation of the Constitution (CIC) to submit a memorandum incorporating CSO feedback and specific recommendations on the draft Bills. The special request was made by Mr. James Wagala and Judge Nyirenda Kenyatta, both from CIC. By sheer coincidence the two had been on a retreat to review the draft Bills a day prior to the round table.</p><h3>Building a supporting ecosystem for open development</h3><p>It became apparent as the round table progressed that KODI cannot stand on its own. It needs support from an ecosystem that can help sustain it from an open development perspective. This ecosystem would be mindful of the interconnectedness and interaction of data producers, intermediaries, technology developers, analysts and users. It would also enable citizens to acquire resources and information to participate in decision making and hold government to account. \u00a0What we really need is openness in all components of development (policy, systems, sectors, content creation, access, use, participation, open licensing, open content, open data, and open government). This should lead to participatory development, strengthen the legitimacy of the government and create a focus on inclusion and social justice.</p><p>In defining the next steps the following recommendations were proposed:</p><ul>\n<li>Submission of a memorandum on FOI and Data Protection Bills to CIC.</li>\n<li>Reconceptualise open development in Kenya to locate KODI in more holistic framework and include what needs to happen at different interfaces.</li>\n<li>Underpin all data/information with \u2018primary questions\u2019 on impact on poverty eradication.</li>\n<li>Extend the concept of openness to all stakeholders \u2013\u00a0not only government. More specifically establish an open civil society in Kenya.</li>\n<li>Create more awareness about what KODI is doing and can do to enhance development objectives, including transparency and accountability.</li>\n<li>Review participation in KODI\u2019s work to include CSOs, academia, research organisations and citizen groups.</li>\n<li>Consider the establishment of a regular mechanism for discussing progress through a reference group.</li>\n</ul><p>These, among others, were identified as critical steps in enhancing civil society engagement in order to create better awareness of KODI and its objectives. More important still was the need to re-define an ecosystem to make it more efficient and effective, bring harmony and value-addition to its work and promote open access to data/information even in situations where technology is inadequate. Of course we must not forget that the primary objective of poverty eradication must be kept alive in KODI\u2019s work if its sustainability is to be assured.</p><p><em>For more information please contact Davis Adieno at davis.adieno@devinit.org\u00a0</em></p><p><em>You can join the conversation on twitter\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://twitter.com/devinitorg\">@devinitorg</a>\u00a0and\u00a0#EnrichKODI \u00a0#Africacounts.</em></p>"}]
